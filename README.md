# Python_Stack



# An overall description of the software:

The software allows the user to register into the platform and process transactions (buy/sell) based on the user's choice of currency. The user must register with a debit card to process payment and receive funds after exchange. Exchange rates are handled by a third party API and updated hourly. An admin account manages users access and privileges and has a dashboard of current site activity/load.
